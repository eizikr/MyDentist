# My Dentist Project

My Dentist is a multiplatform application developed using Flutter and Firebase DB. The app aims to provide a comprehensive solution for dental clinics, assisting with managing various aspects of the clinic's operations. The project was developed by Itzhak Rahamim as a final project for a software engineering degree.

## Features

1. **Settings Options:** The app allows clinic administrators to configure various settings, such as managing assistants, doctors, treatment types, prices, salary, and other customizable parameters.

2. **Patient Card Creation:** The app provides an option to create patient cards containing all relevant patient information, including personal details, medical history, and communication preferences.

3. **Reports and Customer Details:** Users can access detailed reports and customer information to keep track of appointments, treatments, and related details.

4. **Scheduler Planner:** The scheduler planner offers a convenient view of all scheduled treatments and meetings, aiding in efficient clinic management.

5. **Patient Card Details:** The app allows clinicians to access patient card details, including payment requirements, treatment plans, private information, medical data, and communication options.

6. **Prescriptions and Rest Certificates:** My Dentist facilitates the generation and management of prescriptions and rest certificates for work.

## Encryption

Patient data stored in the Firebase database is protected with AES encryption using a robust 256-bit key, ensuring data security and privacy.
